I am a brilliant student, as my teachers said.
During my high school age I participated in several technical competition and I won a prestigious reward at University of Macerata with the project "Blockchain in the circular economy".
I participated in several italian interschool competition regarding cybersecurity and information technology.
I attend several scientific conference about AI and IT more in general.
Nowaday my goals are graduate in computer science engineering and work in an international framework.
